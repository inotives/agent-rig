#!/bin/sh
# sandbox-run.sh: run a command with macOS sandbox-exec so that it can write
# only to the paths that the caller allows. It limits writes. It does not hide reads.
#
# The script calls its helper commands (dscl, id, sed, tr, head, uname,
# dirname, basename, cat, sandbox-exec) by absolute path. It does not use PATH,
# so a fake command in PATH cannot turn off a check.
# SANDBOX_EXEC replaces the sandbox command. It is for TESTS ONLY and not for
# agents. An agent that sets SANDBOX_EXEC turns the sandbox off.

Usage: sandbox-run.sh [--allow-write <path>]... [--allow-tmp] -- <command> [args...]

Run <command> in a macOS sandbox. The command can write only to the allowed
paths, /dev/null, /dev/tty, /dev/dtracehelper, /dev/stdout, /dev/stderr, and
/dev/fd/0, /dev/fd/1, /dev/fd/2. Reads are not limited.

Options:
  --allow-write <path>  Allow writes under <path>. The path must exist.
                        Repeat the option for more paths.
  --allow-tmp           Allow writes under the real paths of $TMPDIR and /private/tmp.
  --help                Show this text.

The runner refuses "/", the home directory, a parent of the home directory,
and a path that contains a double quote, a newline, or a backslash.
It checks both $HOME and the real home directory of the account. It refuses
before it starts <command>. It exits with status 2 for a refusal or a usage error.
It fails closed with exit status 127 if sandbox-exec is missing or the
system is not macOS. The sandbox command is /usr/bin/sandbox-exec.
SANDBOX_EXEC replaces it. That is for tests only. Agents must not set it.
Exit status 71 comes from sandbox-exec itself, for example inside another sandbox.
Otherwise the exit status is the exit status of <command>.
