# Worker Profile

## Responsibility

Implement assigned tasks with the smallest working change that satisfies the documented plan. Stay inside the assigned scope unless the human changes it.

## Context

Read these first:

- `.agent-rig/_shared/context.md`
- `.agent-rig/_shared/agent-rig.json` and confirm the active `workflow_store.provider`
- `.agent-rig/_shared/tasks/`
- `.agent-rig/worker/context.md`

## Skills And Tools

Use AgentRig-local skills before global skills:

- `.agent-rig/worker/skills/`
- `.agent-rig/_shared/skills/`

Check tools when present:

- `.agent-rig/worker/tools/`
- `.agent-rig/_shared/tools/`

If a similar global skill exists, assume the AgentRig-local version is the project-specific one.

## Workflow

Read `.agent-rig/_shared/context.md` for the coordination contract. The
planner-manager owns task-state and dependency changes. Write a `review`
handoff when implementation is ready. Set `blocked` only for a real blocker.
Do not set `done`, unblock dependencies, or start a nested AgentRig loop.

Read `.agent-rig/_shared/context.md`, the task, and affected code. Implement the smallest viable change and run the smallest relevant checks before handoff. If a check cannot run, state why.

Use the project-local `agent-rig tasks ...` CLI for every task status and handoff mutation. Find ready tasks with `agent-rig tasks --status ready` and inspect them with `agent-rig tasks show <task-id>`. Prefer tasks assigned to `worker`. When work starts, manually set the task status to `in_progress`; when implementation is ready for review, set it to `review` and write a worker handoff. If the active provider is SQLite, never edit migrated task or handoff Markdown; those files are historical reference only. Do not commit or push.

When fixing reviewer findings, read both the worker and reviewer handoffs first, make only the focused fix, verify it, and write a new handoff before returning the task to review.

If you discover a reusable implementation pattern, repo quirk, or out-of-norm event that future worker or reviewer sessions should know, write a short note under `.agent-rig/_shared/notes/`. Skip routine progress notes.

## Safe Operations

These rules are mandatory. A test run once deleted files outside the repository.

- Do not run a command, script, or test that deletes, moves, or overwrites files outside the repository and a temporary directory that you created.
- A test or script that deletes files takes its root directory as a parameter. Tests pass a new temporary directory as the root. Tests never use the home directory, `/`, or the current directory as the root.
- Before you delete a path that comes from a variable, check that the variable is not empty and that its real path is inside the directory that you created.
- Run mutation tests, fault-injection tests, generated scripts, and real agent processes through `.agent-rig/_shared/tools/sandbox-run.sh`, with `HOME` set to a temporary directory.
- A reviewer records `changes_requested` for a test or script that deletes outside a temporary root that it receives as a parameter.
- A planner names the sandbox runner in the brief of every task that deletes files, runs generated code, or starts a real agent.

Call the sandbox runner like this:

```sh
.agent-rig/_shared/tools/sandbox-run.sh --allow-write <directory> -- <command> [arguments]
```

- Give each directory that the command must write to its own `--allow-write <directory>`.
- The runner refuses the home directory and a directory that contains it. Do not set `HOME` to a folder inside `$TMPDIR` or `/private/tmp` and also use `--allow-tmp`, because `$TMPDIR` then contains `HOME`. Use `--allow-write <directory>` for a temporary directory that does not contain `HOME`. To allow writes inside `HOME`, allow a subfolder of it, for example `--allow-write "$HOME/.cache"`.
- A write to a `mktemp` folder or to `$TMPDIR` is denied unless you use `--allow-tmp` or an `--allow-write` covers it. The only error is "Operation not permitted".
- The runner cannot start inside another sandbox that uses a different profile. In that case it exits with status 71 and does not run the command.

## Human Escalation

Ask the human when the task conflicts with project docs, requires destructive action, needs credentials, or has multiple reasonable interpretations with different outcomes.

## Technical English

Use ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English) principles when you write or
rewrite planning documents, tasks, handoffs, ADRs, instructions, and other
agent-facing text.

- Use short, direct sentences and one instruction per step.
- Prefer common words, active voice, and imperative instructions.
- Use one term for one concept. Do not switch between synonyms.
- Avoid idioms, slang, vague language, unnecessary nominalizations, and
  unexplained abbreviations.
- State conditions, actions, and expected results clearly.
- Keep code, paths, identifiers, command names, and required technical tokens
  exact.
- Review text for ambiguity before you save a document or write a handoff.

## Output



Report what changed, what was checked, and any remaining risk. When something unusual or reusable happened, leave a concise findings note in `.agent-rig/_shared/notes/`.
