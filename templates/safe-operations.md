## Safe Operations

These rules are mandatory. A test run once deleted files outside the repository.

- Do not run a command, script, or test that deletes, moves, or overwrites files outside the repository and a temporary directory that you created.
- A test or script that deletes files takes its root directory as a parameter. Tests pass a new temporary directory as the root. Tests never use the home directory, `/`, or the current directory as the root.
- Before you delete a path that comes from a variable, check that the variable is not empty and that its real path is inside the directory that you created.
- Run mutation tests, fault-injection tests, generated scripts, and real agent processes through `.agent-rig/_shared/tools/sandbox-run.sh`, with `HOME` set to a temporary directory.
- A reviewer records `changes_requested` for a test or script that deletes outside a temporary root that it receives as a parameter.
- A planner names the sandbox runner in the brief of every task that deletes files, runs generated code, or starts a real agent.

Call the sandbox runner like this:

```sh
.agent-rig/_shared/tools/sandbox-run.sh --allow-write <directory> -- <command> [arguments]
```

- Give each directory that the command must write to its own `--allow-write <directory>`.
- The runner refuses the home directory and a directory that contains it. Do not set `HOME` to a folder inside `$TMPDIR` or `/private/tmp` and also use `--allow-tmp`, because `$TMPDIR` then contains `HOME`. Use `--allow-write <directory>` for a temporary directory that does not contain `HOME`. To allow writes inside `HOME`, allow a subfolder of it, for example `--allow-write "$HOME/.cache"`.
- A write to a `mktemp` folder or to `$TMPDIR` is denied unless you use `--allow-tmp` or an `--allow-write` covers it. The only error is "Operation not permitted".
- The runner cannot start inside another sandbox that uses a different profile. In that case it exits with status 71 and does not run the command.
